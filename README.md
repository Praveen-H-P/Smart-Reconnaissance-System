# Smart-Reconnaissance-System
A comprehensive cybersecurity reconnaissance tool using Python that integrates 20+ OSINT functionalities and network utilities. The tool provides automated modules for IP history, geolocation, ping and traceroute, port scanning, DNS lookups, and vulnerability checks such as Host Header Injection and Clickjacking detection. External APIs like ViewDNS, IP-API, and HackerTarget were used to enhance accuracy and scope. Designed for ethical hackers, penetration testers, and security researchers to streamline recon tasks via a single CLI interface.

Key Features:

- IP & Domain intelligence (IP history, reverse DNS, traceroute, etc.)

- Email, phone, and MAC address lookups

- HTTP header analysis and link extraction

- Reconnaissance modules for Google Analytics, MX, NS records

- Basic vulnerability assessments (Clickjacking & Host Header Injection)

Technologies Used: Python, Requests, JSON, Termcolor, APIs (ViewDNS, IP-API, HackerTarget)
